            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">Last updated: October 17, 2025</p>
            <p>Please read these terms and conditions carefully before using our services. By submitting your information to FSS Reclaims, a department of Fresh Start Solution LLC ("Company", "we", "us", "our"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.</p>

            <h2>1. Our Services</h2>
            <p>We provide specialized services to help former homeowners recover surplus funds that may be owed to them following a foreclosure sale. Our services include auditing government records, preparing claim documentation, and managing the claims process on behalf of our clients. We operate on a contingency fee basis, meaning we only charge a fee if we successfully recover funds for you.</p>

            <h2>2. Use of Your Information</h2>
            <p>When you provide us with your personal information (including but not limited to your name, phone number, email address, property address, and foreclosure date) through the form on our website (funnel.fssllc.co), you consent to us using this information for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Case Evaluation:</strong> To investigate and determine if you are eligible for surplus funds and to assess the potential value of your claim.</li>
                <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To contact you via phone, text message, or email to discuss your case, provide updates, and request necessary documentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Claim Processing:</strong> To prepare and file the necessary legal documents with the appropriate government agencies to recover your funds. This may involve sharing your information with courts, county offices, and other relevant third parties as required by the claims process.</li>
                <li><strong>Service Delivery:</strong> To fulfill our service agreement with you, including sending you an information packet and, upon successful recovery, distributing your funds.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. We will not sell, rent, or share your personal information with any third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

            <h2>3. Communication and Opt-Out Options</h2>
            <p>By submitting your information, you agree to receive communications from us. You have the right to opt out of these communications at any time.</p>
            <h3>How to Opt-Out:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Email:</strong> To stop receiving emails, you can click the "unsubscribe" link provided in the footer of our emails or reply directly with the word "UNSUBSCRIBE."</li>
                <li><strong>Text Messages:</strong> To stop receiving text messages, you can reply with the word "STOP" at any time. You may receive one final confirmation message.</li>
                <li><strong>Phone Calls:</strong> To be added to our internal "Do Not Call" list, please inform our representative during any phone call or email us at info@fssreclaims.com with your request and phone number.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. No Legal Advice</h2>
            <p>FSS Reclaims is not a law firm, and its employees are not attorneys. We do not provide legal advice. Our services are strictly limited to asset recovery and administrative claim processing. If you require legal advice, you should consult with a licensed attorney.</p>

            <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <p>While we strive for a high success rate, we do not guarantee the successful recovery of any funds. The outcome of each case depends on various factors, including the accuracy of government records, statutes of limitations, and potential claims from other parties.</p>
            
            <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms and conditions at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page. Your continued use of our services after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p>
